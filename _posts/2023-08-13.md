The enemy knows my position because I left my radar on and a merchant ship reported me. I've since vacated that position but I know that an enemy strike group is coming to investigate.

Originally, my plan was to sneak around the enemy, but then I receive a second, juicier radio intercept revealing the enemy's position, speed and destination. New plan: attack with fast, long-range bombers from my carrier.

I plotted out on the map where I thought the enemy would be at a given time and did a test flight to see how long my airstrike would take to reach that location. At the appointed time, I launch the airstrike.

My planes arrive on target and no sign of the enemy. I leave the main body to loiter and send one to scout. Just when I think I've done it all wrong my scout picks up the enemy; they had deviated slightly from the course I predicted but weren't far off. In comes the airstrike...

...which does absolutely nothing thanks to the enemy's heavy top armor and anti-aircraft guns :sweat_smile:

In a rage, I fire a *nuclear missile* at where I thought the enemy fleet would be. The missile failed to find the enemy and represents half of my nuclear arsenal.

Two planes and a valuable missile lost. Furthermore, the enemy has a better idea of where I am.

But all is not in vain. I've learned that...
* The enemy strike group has 3 heavy ships with good top armor and quite a few small guns - perhaps 4x 37mm each?
* My airstrikes (1 flight of 2 planes, 1 flight of 3 planes) weren't heavy enough to damage the enemy.
