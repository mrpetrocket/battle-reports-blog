The fleet threads the needle between enemy radar installations. Double shifts of operators man the IR scanner. Incoming planes from Shahrihan could spell disaster; incoming nuclear missiles from Yezid could be the end of the fleet.

The fleet's destination? The shipyard at Karkemish. Here, I will build a second raiding ship to give my lone, overworked Lightning a rest.

To start, I bought a similar-looking ship from mercenaries: a "Fenek"-class. I will transfer its valuable air defense missiles to the flagship, then bolt on engines, guns and a skull-and-crossbones flag to make a raiding machine.

The first yard progress report looks good:

_I think "Fenek" is a type of fox..._

Then - _thermal signature detected!_

A passing merchantman has alerted the enemy. The thermal signature indicates inbound planes or nukes; the raiding force lifts and rushes north from the shipyard. The thermal signature fades; in its place, a pursuing enemy squadron. I don't want to fight them with my damaged Lightning and half-built Starfox but the enemy's speed leaves me no choice.

_Mystery enemy squadron. Escorts of the missile carrier in Yezid?_

These ships may look bigger than mine, but they're missile corvettes. Once those missiles are expended, they're slow target practice for the Lightning. I use the Starfox to bait out and dodge the short-range missiles, then escape and let the Lightning's guns do the talking.

But unfortunately, this victorious engagement would be the Starfox' last. I return to the shipyard and try to finish the Starfox' construction. I discover a problem.

![The fatal flaw](/battle-reports-blog/assets/images/2023-08-26/critical_flaw.jpg)
The original Fenek was built with the bridge on the center line of the ship; the Lightning is built with the bridge to one side. I can try to squeeze the necessary bits into the Starfox, or rebuild to look exactly like the Lightning. I decide to do it "right" and remove all pieces from the Starfox to make it look exactly like its raider cousin.

Removing all pieces from the ship deletes the ship. The Starfox is gone. Boom. Just like it had stayed in Karkemish when the missiles probably arrived.

The Duke doesn't make mistakes. The foreman of the shipyard is killed; someone more loyal is put in his place. The raiding fleet sets out from Karkemish.

But the crew of the Lightning, whose lives were saved by the Starfox in the Battle of Karkemish, will always remember The First And Last Flight of the Star Fox.
