While my main fleet was busy lighting up the sky over Samrah, my raiding force was busy negotiating gas money from the enemy's trade convoys.

The main combatant of the raiding force, the "Lightning", is everything the cruiser "Kormoran" is not. The Lightning is a fast, nimble dancer whose survivability depends 100% on the pilot's ability to dodge shells. It's great fun until the pilot trips over their shoes.

In one battle, a convoy escort gravely wounded one of my Lightnings. The Lightning was something like half a Lightning now; no landing gear, missing engines and a giant hole torn in the center. This Lightning nevertheless managed to land on its belly without exploding and went on to make a full recovery. I gave this ship an appropriate name: "Sullenberg".
