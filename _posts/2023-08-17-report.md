*This play session was in the morning. This is pertinent.*

My flagship flees before the superior enemy strike group. I believe that the strike group will investigate my last known position east of Kush but fail to guess where I have gone. I have just reached Assan when the ELINT alarm sounds. ELINT means that I am detecting nearby enemy radar emissions. This alarm surprised me and I am genuinely worried. *Is the enemy following me?*

Almost simultaneously with the ELINT alarm, Squadron 1 to the north reports this radio intercept:

"Donbass" is the CIC's designation for the enemy strike group. At speed 110, where could Donbass show up in one hour?

If my ELINT detection level is 1, Donbass can't be within 110 km of me. That leaves Kush as their only possible destination. *If* my interpretation of this message is right, then Donbass has failed to find me and is returning to Kush; the ELINT pickup is just a whisper of Donbass' radar at the edge of my range.

I maintain course and wait. The ELINT alarm falls silent; the enemy is not pursuing. But not a minute later I hear another beeping alarm. No visual cues. What is this? Is this what an inbound nuclear strike sounds like?

The sound I heard was *my IRL alarm clock in the next room*. My flagship is safe and I probably need to spend more time off of the bridge.
