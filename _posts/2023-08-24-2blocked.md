Victory over Arzamas has given me options. I could run north - or I could ambush whichever  strike group comes to investigate the recent battle. Intelligence reports suggest that the remaining two strike groups will combine their forces; destroying the second-to-last strike group in isolation would remove that possibility.

I decide to ambush Soyuz. I use the Arzamas playbook: buy Soyuz' last position from the locals, scout their new position with raiders and nail them with the heavy cruiser hammer. Unfortunately, I fail to learn from previous mistakes.

_580 hours is more than enough time to reload._

My raiders detect the first southbound missile salvo from Soyuz and run west. But Soyuz has more than two tubes. One Lightning bravely takes three additional cruise missiles while the rest of the raiders retreat. A Lightning destroyed, her crew lost.

I realize now that strategy I used to destroy Arzamas will not work for Soyuz. Soyuz won't chase my raiders into the flagship's guns; they are perfectly comfortable sitting in place and lobbing standoff weapons in my general direction. If I try to advance on Soyuz with the flagship, they will have more than enough time to reload and fire again. Any cruise missile hit has the potential to ground or even destroy the flagship.

The harsher reality here is that the "Heavy Cruiser Hammer" isn't just one page in my playbook; it's my *only* play for taking on enemy strike groups. Despite earlier successes, my cash is low and my fleet is bare. Aside from the flagship, I have the two raiders and a carrier with a less-than-full complement of aircraft. I need more options to defeat an entrenched missile battery like Soyuz.

I leave Soyuz and mass my forces - such as they are - to advance north along the path previously blocked by Arzamas. If I can't defeat Soyuz, I can at least advance toward the enemy capital while raising some capital of my own for new ships and new tactical possibilities.

Unfortunately, I find a terrible surprise.

The battle with Arzamas *had* drawn someone's attention - the fifth, unknown strike group "Kavkaz" - who does a competent Soyuz impression by destroying my carrier with cruise missiles and then sitting comfortably to the north while reloading.

Both routes north are now blocked by strike groups who can see and shoot me down long before I can come into range. Waiting or running the long way through the desert is impossible; additional intelligence underscores the urgency of moving north as fast as possible.

I am out of options.

Except one.
