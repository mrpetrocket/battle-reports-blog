The entire fleet did not make a clean escape from Arzamas. Cruise missile strikes finally destroy the Kormoran as well as the fast tanker from my raiding squadron. My raiders are grounded; my heavy ships take refuge in a hidden city for repairs. Furthermore, I discover that one of the cruise missile strikes came from yet another strike group codenamed "Soyuz". At least I know where two of the three remaining groups are...

I repair my fleet and scour the desert for new ships and defenses against cruise missiles. I need to break out of this southern region and move north to the campaign objective. No more circling back around strike fleets; the next push needs to succeed.
