My flagship and squadron 1 are grounded in the desert southeast of Ghadjar after the fruitless air-and-missile attack against the enemy strike group. The enemy is too strong for a frontal assault, but the only other city in range is Kush which is now swarming with spies who will report my arrival. I do my best sand dune impression and wait for the dangerous ships to move on.

While the flagship hides, I send the fastest ships of squadron 2 to Abad to capture a merchant ship and get some cash. I expect an easy victory but end up restarting the fight so many times that my crews' morale drops to zero and mutiny breaks out. Now, the merchant ship is guarded by its escorts *and* my angry former sailors.

:angry::angry:

I retaliate with air strikes from the remaining ship of squadron 2. These strikes handily subdue the garrison and the mutineers, enabling me to capture the prize ship. Don't ask why I didn't do this before sending in the little ships. You don't question the Grand Duke. I feel pride in my former sailors, however; the one survivor of the airstrikes, a mutinous tanker formerly of squadron 2, had no weapons but courageously attempted to kamikaze my carrier.

Meanwhile, the enemy refuses to leave Ghadjar so I reluctantly move south to Kush for fuel. ![Kush](/battle-reports-blog/assets/images/2023-08-15/kush_dangerous.jpg)
I have barely had a chance to click "Print My Receipt" at the pump when some lousy local phones the enemy. *Now* the enemy leaves Ghadjar...

By coincidence, I now know the composition of the enemy strike group. A local lord joined me with his impressive cruiser. I realized that I have seen that ship before - from the reports of the pilots who attacked the strike group. The enemy has three of that exact cruiser; good thing I did not attack them head on.
