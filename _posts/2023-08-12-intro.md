I just got Highfleet after watching a few episodes of an [awesome playthrough](https://youtu.be/hCHO66KtQKc). I enjoy sharing battle reports from these kinds of games so I am going to post them here. I will try to keep away from story spoilers.

A noble house has unwisely given me command of their fleet of rocket-powered air vessels and ordered me to squash the rebellion in the northern desert wastes.

Specifically, I have been tasked with capturing the enemy stronghold far to the north. My fleet has neither the fuel nor firepower to immediately carry out this task. To succeed, I will need to advance slowly, making allies and buying resources from desert cities, all while avoiding destruction at the hands of enemy fleets looking for me.

I have a plan based on that playthrough I linked:
* I will split my initial fleet into three groups. Two groups are fast-moving strike groups that will act as the vanguard and clear enemy garrisons ahead of the flagship. The third group will be the slow-moving flagship and its escorts.
* My intermediate objectives will be the capture of enemy fleet bases which act as campaign save points.
