Am I an unredeemable monster for launching a nuclear strike? The Duke does not ponder such things. The Duke commands; the shifting sands of the desert will decide how his story is remembered.

One thing is certain: the enemy will respond. From now on, any incoming cruise missile may be tipped with a nuclear warhead. Good thing I'm so skilled at avoiding damage from cruise missiles...:expressionless:

Now that I have broken through to the north, it's time to change up my strategy. My objective is not the destruction of enemy strike groups or dodging cruise missiles; it's capturing the city of Khiva, far to the north. News of the wider war lend increasing urgency to this objective. I need to pick up the pace.

_Welcome to Khiva, home of the world's last nuclear reactor!_

I am far to the south, my fleet is a ragtag band and my coffers are empty. I need to fix all of these problems if I am to have a chance at capturing Khiva.

Here are my goals:
* Prioritize moving north over side-trip battles.
* Raise funds to strengthen my fleet. I can do this by sending my fast raiders after merchant ships.
* Add another ship to my raiding force. My lone Lightning is fighting increasingly frightening odds and is low on morale. This Lightning performs multiple roles in the fleet; its loss might end my campaign.
* Find at least one more heavy combatant to join my flagship for the Khiva assault. Do this later so that we aren't spending fuel moving it around.
