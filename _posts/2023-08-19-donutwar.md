Despite victory over the enemy strike group "Donbass", I know that a second strike group "Arzamas" blocks the way north from Samrah. Its speed of 85 - slower than Donbass' 110 - makes me believe that it is centered around a capital ship heavier than a cruiser. I have no desire to throw my fleet against an unknown danger and I withdraw.

I fly south and west in a circle around Arzamas to capture Nagar. Near Nagar are a fuel depot and shipyard for my damaged Kormoran; I plan to visit each before making a move on Nagar. I make a pit stop at a city south of Nagar and all at once my plan is vaporized.

I detect a heat signature to the north. I send a plane to investigate; the heat is radiating from a flock of cruise missiles sent with love from Nagar. Spies have sold me out and an enemy fleet in Nagar responded immediately with a strategic bombardment. I fail to shoot down one missile and it takes a huge chunk out of the Kormoran, dropping my fleet's top speed by a third and leaving me without enough fuel to reach the next city.

"Aftermath of the missile strike. Red line indicates that my fleet lacks the fuel to reach its intended destination."

I have a dilemma. I must leave this city or face additional bombardment. Furthermore, I expect the enemy in Nagar to follow up their long-range message with an in-person visit. But the crippled Kormoran slows my fleet and leaves me without enough fuel to reach the next town. Do I leave her and her crew in the city and escape? I decide that I will not abandon the heroes of the battle against strike group Donbass. I will travel as far as I can with the Kormoran, then leave her briefly hidden in the desert while I gather fuel in the next town.

Some nail-biting hours and gas cans trucked back through the desert later, the entire fleet including the Kormoran is safely at Bethharan. I initially believe that I am being pursued by Arzamas, but my scouts reveal that the situation is even worse.

Arzamas has brought a friend. A second strike group "Ingul" has joined the fight and is now pursuing me. There is no time to make repairs to the stricken Kormoran, only to refuel and flee north. The constant ELINT alarm reminds me that Ingul is pursuing and catching up.

I know that Ingul is faster than me and can force an engagement. I again consider dropping the Kormoran. If I do not, I will have to commit my flagship to fight. My flagship is powerful but I've never fired its guns and if I lose it, I am pretty sure I lose the game.

I decide to defend the stricken Kormoran and turn to engage the enemy south of Kush. The point of giving battle outside the city is that if I win, the enemy sighting and what I assume will be Arzamas' follow-up missile salvo will land outside of Kush and not on my surviving ships docked in the city.

The outcome of the battle? Let me just show you a picture of the relative sizes of the ships. The Sevastopol is my flagship.

I have made a terrible mistake in keeping the Sevastopol out of fights. The flagship is an absolute monster; it had no problems wrecking the four enemy light cruisers. Strike Group Ingul - eliminated.

But there is still a threat. Arzamas is out there with cruise missiles to which I have no counter and will have no problems punching similar donut holes in my flagship. I send my raiding squadron on a daring mission *to Arzamas' last location* to see if I can bait them away.

"Ding dong dash, but the neighbors have cruise missiles"

The ruse is successful. My raiders generate such a string of sightings across the map that Arzamas was obligated to veer away from my fleet and investigate.

I am safe and have discovered what a beast my flagship is, but I have also taken a great deal of damage and don't feel comfortable moving north with Arzamas at my back. I retreat to repair and plan my next move.
