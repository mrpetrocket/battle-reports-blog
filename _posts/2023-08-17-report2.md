I'm safe from the enemy strike group and have even made progress north. My next objective is to amass in Tabal and strike the enemy aircraft carrier group in Bethel. This enemy formation threatens me because it has the range to launch air strikes against me if I try to take the fleet base in Zoba to the north.

I attack and destroy the enemy carrier group, but the outcome of the attack is mixed. Here is how it went down:

1. I send a scout plane to Bethel. My opposing number launches its own plane; mine wins the dogfight and scouts the enemy numbers.
1. The scout confirms that I can take the enemy formation in a brawl. My attack force lifts from Tabal.
1. Just before my ships come into the enemy's radar range, I launch an airstrike against the enemy. I arm most of my planes with bombs and only a few with anti-air weapons.
1. The enemy counters with equal numbers of aircraft, all armed with anti-air loadouts. My airstrike is shredded.
1. My ships reach Bethel. My cruiser  wrecks the enemy group in close combat. The enemy ships are designed for airstrikes and air defense, not brawling. The one silver lining of my disastrous airstrike is that all of the enemy's planes were refueling when my cruiser lumbered in.

The enemy aircraft carrier group is no longer a threat, but I have lost many valuable planes and alerted the enemy to my presence. My old friend, strike group Donbass, is too far south to be an immediate threat, but I don't know if other strike groups are nearby. I will continue north, scouting ahead of the advance.
