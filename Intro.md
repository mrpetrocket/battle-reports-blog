A noble house has unwisely given me command of their fleet of rocket-powered air vessels and ordered me to squash the rebellion in the northern desert wastes.

I have been tasked with capturing an enemy stronghold far to the north. My fleet has neither the fuel nor firepower to immediately carry out this task. To succeed, I will need to advance slowly, making allies and buying resources from desert cities, all while avoiding destruction at the hands of enemy fleets looking for me.

I have a plan based on the beginning of the [awesome playthrough]() I watched.
* I will split my initial fleet into three groups. Two groups are fast-moving strike groups that will act as the vanguard and clear enemy garrisons ahead of the flagship. The third group will be the slow-moving flagship and its escorts.
* My intermediate objectives will be the capture of enemy fleet bases which act as campaign save points.
