radio intercept told me that the "Donbass" fleet would arrive in City A (TODO) in ten hours.
my veteran instincts honed from one youtube video and peer pressure from a bloodthirsty accomplice suggested that instead of avoiding Donbass, I should attack.
I mapped out a possible ambush zone and launched my planes (sub-sonic fighters, rocket runs). the planes arrived at the suggested location and found nothing. one scouted while the rest loitered.
then - success. Donbass was nearby. I vectored in the planes for the assault...
...and watched as they did next to nothing in the face of heavy top armor and a blizzard of flak.
In a rage, I fired a nuclear missile at where I thought Donbass would be. The missile missed; I only had two of them to start.
Two planes and a very valuable missile lost. Furthermore, Donbass has a better idea of where I am.

But all is not in vain. I've learned that...
* Donbass has 3 heavy ships with good top armor and quite a few small guns - perhaps 4x 37mm each?
* My airstrikes (1 set of 2 planes, 1 set of 3 planes) weren't heavy enough to damage Donbass.
