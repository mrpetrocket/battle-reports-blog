# It's Time
(TODO invasion usa meme)

The enemy strike force Arzamas has been a menace to my fleet. Its cruise missiles ~~and my poor handling thereof~~ unforgivably murdered the Hero of the Battle of Samrah and exacted tens of thousands in damages and evasion fuel. Furthermore, Arzamas blocks the way north to the enemy capital. No more evading - it is time for revenge.

# The Plan
(TODO: the map)

Advance. Find Arzamas. Destroy them, then break north to our ultimate objective.

I believe my heavy cruiser flagship can destroy Arzamas - four light cruisers, one carrier - in a close quarters brawl. My fleet is faster than Arzamas: 110 vs 85. All I need to do is locate Arzamas, survive its initial cruise missile salvo and close to artillery range. Unfortunately, my desert wanderings did not turn up the interceptor missiles or supersonic fighters I need to hard-counter cruise missiles. I will use my fast raiding ships as a screen to bait out Arzamas' missiles; if I am careful and watch my sensors, the raiders are fast enough to evade a missile strike.

# Striking Out
Our friends in the desert relay to us Arzamas' last position. Refueled and rearmed, we take our leave of the hospitality of the Hidden Peoples and advance north. 

(TODO: we have some good pics of this chase)

Elint warnings near Kafr. No doubt Arzamas. I send out planes to investigate but find nothing.
Then - thermal signature detected by the scout force. Cruise missiles. I split the raiding force in opposite directions. One thermal signature fails to find us.
The other explodes directly underneath the tanker, severely wounding it but leaving it alive.

I trace the missile launches back and launch planes. I find the enemy and win a 3 on 4 dogfight in which only they had missiles - awesome! And my planes find the enemy.
Arzamas is directly north. My raiding force must have passed right by them!


# Enemy in Sight
(TODO: first Arzamas sighting)

Arzamas' planes are now exhausted. Its cruise missile tubes are empty. And it is chasing my faster raiding force.
They have no idea that my main force is behind them. I have them exactly where I want them.

Probably: launch cruise missile salvo and hope for a speed decrease. Maybe lead the raiders in a circle so that Arzamas comes to us. Get into artillery range and let the Sevastopol show them the might of the Romani Empire.
