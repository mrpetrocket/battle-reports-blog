Refueled and rearmed, it is time to take our leave of the hospitality of the hidden people and advance.
I intend to exact revenge on Arzamas for the destruction of my ships and break out north to the enemy capital.

I think I can take them in a close-in brawl. My planes can face their planes. Cruise missiles are the real threat. I have two countermeasures.
First - planes with air-to-air missiles. Second - my raiding force as bait.

Elint warnings near Kafr. No doubt Arzamas. I send out planes to investigate but find nothing.
Then - thermal signature detected by the scout force. Cruise missiles. I split the raiding force in opposite directions. One thermal signature fails to find us.
The other explodes directly underneath the tanker, severely wounding it but leaving it alive.

I trace the missile launches back and launch planes. I find the enemy and win a 3 on 4 dogfight in which only they had missiles - awesome! And my planes find the enemy.
Arzamas is directly north. My raiding force must have passed right by them!

Arzamas' planes are now exhausted. Its cruise missile tubes are empty. And it is chasing my faster raiding force.
They have no idea that my main force is behind them. I have them exactly where I want them.
