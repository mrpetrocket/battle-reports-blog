While my main fleet was busy lighting up the sky over Gerat with the artillery duel against Donbass, my speedy raiding force was busy robbing the enemy's trade convoys.

The main combatant of the raiding force, the "Lightning", is everything the cruiser "Kormoran" is not. In battle, its tactics are not "how much armor do I have?" but rather "how many shells can I dodge?" The answer is "a lot"; it's a hell of a lot of fun to fly. While the Kormoran and most heavy ships rely on their armor, the answer to "how many enemies can I take in a single Lightning" comes down to "how many shells can I dodge?" TODO

In one battle, a convoy escort gravely wounded one of my Lightnings. The Lightning was something like half a Lightning now; no landing gear, missing engines and a giant hole torn in the center. _Premonition much?_ This Lightning nevertheless managed to land on its belly without exploding and went on to make a full recovery. I gave this ship an appropriate name.
(TODO: I hope I have a pic).
