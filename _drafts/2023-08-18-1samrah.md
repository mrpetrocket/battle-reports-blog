* 1v4 lightning fight, one try
* nearly lost a lightning in another fight, landed with no landing gear and a huge hole in the ship center; ship is now the Sullenberg
* discovered danger in the north. new SG with air power in Zoba kept
* decided to fight donbass head-on to the south. three tries but beat them with the Kormoran. 180mm gun duel was epic.

plan: circle south and west back to Nagar. Zero intel on Arzamas 

three new threats:
1. SG "Arzamas" in Zoba with air power
1. 4 ships in Nagar. guessing frigates because their guns were 130mm.
1. Unknown launching planes at me from the south. Possibilities: A plane from Zoba that turned around north after not finding me; respawned "Pirate" TG; other.
