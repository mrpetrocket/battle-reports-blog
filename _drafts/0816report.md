get away from the enemy strike fleet.
almost to the next city when the elint alarm goes off. oh shit. are they following me?
then I get a radio intercept. donbass going 110 less than an hour. I think it means that they're landing in kush and they're less than an hour out. that would make sense if they just went to my reported location.
I was right.
Just after the flagship elint alarm finally turns off I hear another alarm. I was like what now... but it was just my real alarm I forgot to turn off in the other room.
Now going to meet up NE and destroy the carrier strike group.
Carrier from squadron 2 flew as far as it could. Then a tanker from squadron 1 came out to refuel it and bring it home. The squadrons are united as the vanguard. Next I will take that NE city, form up a big strike force centered around my Kormoran and go blast the enemy aircraft carrier.
