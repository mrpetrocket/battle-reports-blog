My flagship flees before the superior enemy strike group. I believe that the strike group will investigate my last known position east of Kush but fail to guess where I have gone. I am nearly to (TODO the next city) when the ELINT alarm sounds. ELINT means that I am detecting nearby enemy radar emissions. This alarm surprised me and I am genuinely worried. *Is the enemy following me?*

Almost simultaneously with the ELINT alarm, Squadron 1 to the north reports this radio intercept:
(TODO pic of snippet here, but just the snippet).
"Donbass" is the CIC's designation for the enemy strike group. At speed 110, where could Donbass show up in one hour?
(TODO pic here)
If my ELINT detection level is 1, Donbass can't be within 110 km of me. That leaves Kush as the only possible destination. *If* my interpretation of this message is right, then Donbass has failed to find me and is returning to Kush; the ELINT pickup is just a whisper of Donbass' radar at the edge of my range.

I maintain course and wait. The ELINT alarm falls silent; the enemy is not pursuing. But not a minute later I hear another beeping alarm. No visual cues. What is this? Is this what an inbound nuclear strike sounds like?

No lie - *the sound I heard was my IRL alarm clock in the next room*. My flagship is safe and I probably need to spend more time off of the bridge.



I'm safe from the enemy strike group and have even made progress north. My next objective is to regroup in (TODO city) and strike the enemy tactical group in (TODO city, Bethel iirc?). This group is important because it has the range to launch air strikes against me if I try to take the fleet base in (TODO city, Zoba?) I believe that the tactical groups have less front-up firepower




get away from the enemy strike fleet.
almost to the next city when the elint alarm goes off. oh shit. are they following me?
then I get a radio intercept. donbass going 110 less than an hour. I think it means that they're landing in kush and they're less than an hour out. that would make sense if they just went to my reported location.
I was right.
Just after the flagship elint alarm finally turns off I hear another alarm. I was like what now... but it was just my real alarm I forgot to turn off in the other room.
Now going to meet up NE and destroy the carrier strike group.
Carrier from squadron 2 flew as far as it could. Then a tanker from squadron 1 came out to refuel it and bring it home. The squadrons are united as the vanguard. Next I will take that NE city, form up a big strike force centered around my Kormoran and go blast the enemy aircraft carrier.
