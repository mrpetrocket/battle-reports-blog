"Crunchy donut with methane cream filling"

Despite victory over the enemy strike group "Donbass", I know that a second strike group "Arzamas" blocks the way north.

Arzamas has sortied from its fleet base, heading west to investigate the sighting at Calah. It has air power. Its speed is 85 which is slower than Donbass; I believe that indicates something heavier.

I decide to fly south and west in a circle to capture Nagar and leave Arzamas doing nothing to the east. I spend too long in a city; the city becomes dangerous. I still need the fuel so I wait.

Then suddenly, a heat signature to the north. I send a plane; it's a *cruise missile* with love from Nagar. Someone in Nagar took the call from their spy and responded immediately with a full cruise missile salvo. Props for blind trust because it worked out well for them. I failed to shoot down one missile and it took a chunk out of the Kormoran, dropping the group's top speed by 1/3 and leaving me without enough fuel to go to Bethharan.
(Pretty sure this was Ingal; A Gryphon has strategic missile capability)
