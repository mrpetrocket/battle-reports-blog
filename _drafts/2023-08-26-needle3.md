TODO I want to play up the "death by deletion".

The raiders return to the shipyard and here is where I suffer my biggest casualty of the needle campaign. While modifying the Fenek into the Starfox, I realize I have moved all of my pieces one tile to the left. I remove all pieces to start again. When I do this, the ship auto-deletes. I was pretty salty. I haven't lost any money- I retain the pieces. But now my only raider remains my low-morale "RIOT DANGER" Lightning.

Thankfully, the enemy is busy refueling its planes, so I can rest up and bring my morale to bare minimum levels. I reach a mercenary port. Time to get some additional combatants and build a real attack corvette.
