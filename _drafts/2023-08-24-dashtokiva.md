Options now. We know that Soyuz and the unknown strike fleet will be coming to find us. Pick a fight with Soyuz now to keep them off of our backs? Or just press north to a repair base.
Make sure to buy stuff at the current store.
I just noticed N-labelled "missile carriers" to the north. Gulp.

initially I plan to bring soyuz to battle. instead I lose another lightning to cruise missile strikes and I realize yeah no, this isn't going to work.
I go the other way north. oh look, another strike group "Kavkaz" blocking the way with even more cruise missile tubes. lose my longbow and my entire aircraft wing. shit.
well, story is getting more desperate, it's time.
I salvo nukes. nuke kavkaz twice times and then run past. lightning raids to capture nearby fuel depots and get intel. Kavkaz still there? another nuke for good measure.
the "fire nukes" has consequences. if I fire them, the enemy will use them, and I have zero defense.
This is the mad dash to Khiva.
