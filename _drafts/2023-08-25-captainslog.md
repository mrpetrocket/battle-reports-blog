I capture cities in rapid succession with my Lightning, winning battles that the Lightning has no business winning. Seriously - this thing is eventually going to take a fatal hit and my raider bus number is precisely one (1). I need to beef up my raiding force.


Or just press north to a repair base.
Make sure to buy stuff at the current store.



my fleet is bare. flagship, damaged strat corvette and the raider force (only one lightning).
I know I will be facing nuclear missiles. I simply can't be caught by them.
I believe I need another heavy combatant to face off at Khiva. I also need to avoid getting caught by cruise missiles. Move light.
Got a Fenek.
My lightning is winning by the absolute skin of its teeth.
I feel like I have zero margin. If I lose the Lightning, I lose the game. Why? I can't capture points ahead of the flagship; without that, I will generate sightings every time I enter town.
Well. In that case, we either need a bigger raiding force or a better Lightning.
I could buy a corvette and slim it down.
Or - we need to start slinging more nukes.
We won't be able to capture every point we come across. Important ones only. Fuel probably most important.
steal the R9s off the Fenek and turn the chassis into a Lightning 2. Forget fenek fox; starfox?

I've talked a lot about enemy strike groups but let's take a moment to talk about the ultimate objective. It's not winning a fleet battle or dodging cruise missiles - it's this. Khiva, the enemy capital. TODO: we need a pic.

Surrounding Khiva are defense fleets like this:
_Yes, that's a letter "N"._

Defeating enemy strike groups has limited the amount of mobile firepower that the enemy can send against me, but to win I must take Khiva.

I don't know exactly what's in Khiva, but I imagine my flagship won't be enough. I believe I need at least one more heavy combatant.

My Lightning has won back-to-back fights that her crew had no business winning. They are stretched to the breaking point and I expect we will soon run into impossible targets. I need a bigger or meaner raiding force.
