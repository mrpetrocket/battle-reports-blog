8/10

My first objective is to advance my flagship north to a fuel depot. I send out my two vanguard squadrons NE and NW to sweep enemy garrisons from towns ahead of the flagship. One of my raids is reported and will be investigated by the enemy, but I am not worried because this raid took place west of the flagship's intended path.

The flagship, fueled and given the all-clear by the vanguard ahead, takes off with its radar pinging loudly. A merchant vessel wanders by, detects the radar and alerts the enemy. I demand its cargo but the damage is done - now the enemy has a confirmed sighting on my flagship.

Soon after, I intercept radio traffic revealing that an enemy strike group is moving toward the flagship's last known position. The shortest path from the enemy's known position would take it directly through the fuel depot where I intend to land the flagship. I change course; I send the flagship and one vanguard fleet further east around the strike group.

The day ends with my fleet divided: east squadron and the flagship close together; west squadron cut off from the fleet by the approaching enemy strike group.
