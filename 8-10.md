8/10?
I send out my two vanguard squadrons to sweep enemy garrisons from towns ahead of the flagship. One of my squadrons uses a fast ship (Lightning); the other uses a much slower ship (Navarin) that I wanted to try. The first raid of the Navarin goes wrong as the garrison gets off a warning before falling to the Navarin's guns. Now the enemy will come to investigate - until I make an even bigger mistake.

The flagship, fueled and given the all-clear by the vanguard ahead, takes off with its radar pinging loudly. A merchant vessel wanders by, detects the radar and alerts the enemy. I demand its cargo as tribute but the damage is done - now the enemy knows two places I have been!

Soon after, I intercept radio traffic showing that an enemy strike group is moving toward the flagship's last known position. The shortest path from the enemy's known position would take it directly through the city where I intend to plop the flagship for its next fueling. I decide to cut that visit short and send the flagship and one vanguard fleet east around the strike group.

Meanwhile, the second vanguard (with the Navarin) is cut off to the west - cut off because the only way for it to rejoin the flagship takes it through the path where at least one enemy strike group is coming. They will have to continue alone in the west.
